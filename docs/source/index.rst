Welcome to TensorCI
===================

`TensorCI`_ brings Continuous Integration to machine learning. It orchestrates the process of managing datasets,
training and evaluating models, and then deploying those models to an API to serve predictions -- all with simple commands.

Offloading the continuous cycle of **training --> testing --> predicting --> repeat** as your algorithm develops or new data accumulates
over time allows for more focus on your algorithm and less on managing systems overhead.
