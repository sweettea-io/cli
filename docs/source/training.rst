Model Training
==============

Once you've `created a dataset`_, training your model on the TensorCI training cluster is easy::

  $ tensorci train

Running the ``train`` command deploys the latest commit of your project's git repo to the TensorCI training cluster, preprocesses
your dataset, trains your model, evaluates that model, and then uploads that model to TensorCI model storage.
