Environment Variables
=====================

Custom environment variables can be set for your TensorCI project by navigating to ``https://app.tensorci.com/<TEAM_SLUG>/<PROJECT_SLUG>/settings/envs``.

These custom envs are broken up into 2 different groups -- **Training Envs** and **API Envs** -- allowing you to specify
different envs for when your project is training vs. when it's serving predictions.

Modifying these envs with the CLI is planned for future development but can only be done via the TensorCI dashboard
as of now.
